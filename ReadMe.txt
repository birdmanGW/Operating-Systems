SINGLYLINKEDLIST
-has pre made main statements to execute every required method, values can be hand typed into insert, sort, and delete calls

DOUBLYLINKEDLIST
-has pre made main statements to execute every required method, values can be hand typed into insert, sort, and delete calls

BINARYSEARCHTREE
-made as an actual tree, with left and right binary tree nodes corresponding to children
-had problems with search node returning boolean {0} and {1}, so instead provided a print statement that will display wheteher or not search node has been found, or not.  However, will print
it has not found the node twice, just so you are aware.
-has pre made main statements to execute every required method, values can be hand typed into insert, sort, and delete calls
-DISPLAY METHOD: used as a rough debig purpose, will print left nodes closest to the parent node, right nodes spaced farthest away (sorry for visual confusion)

PRIORITYQUEUE
-has pre made main statements to execute every required method, values can be hand typed into insert, sort, and delete calls
-uses a linkedlist structure with priority descending order
-head always points to highest priority node
-extractMax will print the max priorty node's priority (always head) 
-Increase and Decrease both append/decrement the affected priority, then save the values, delete the old node from the queue, then re add the node back via the insert function, retaining order 
and ensuring that head ALWAYS points to maxPriority value.

circularLinkedList
-incomplete, grade as necessary
